# Suggestion guide

## Setting a suggestions channel

you can set the suggestions channel using `/suggestion channel <channel>`, `/suggestion acceptedchannel <channel>` and `/suggestion deniedchannel <channel>`

after that sending messages in the suggestions channel will trigger the creation of a suggestion

## Managing suggestions

The 2 main commands for managing suggestions are `suggestion deny` and `suggestion accept` these 2 commands can be used to send the suggestions to a different channel such as the denied channel and this will end the voting on the suggestions too!

| delete                        | accept                        | restore                        |
